# Card Generator Backend

This repository contains the backend service for a card generator website. The service is responsible for dynamically creating and generating images of playing cards based on user-provided details. Built with C# ASP.NET, it offers a robust and scalable API layer for handling requests, processing card details, and rendering card images. The backend uses PostgreSQL as its database for reliable data storage and management. To ensure portability and ease of deployment, the application is fully containerized with Docker, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. The frontend for the card generator website is developed separately in Angular and is available in its own GitHub repository.
